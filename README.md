# Bod Plugins

External plugins for OpenOSRS that focus on automation, this is a seperate entity, not OpenOSRS.

The purpose of this repository is primarily for my own learning but also to provide open-source examples of automation using plugins. 

# Use
You will need to add Paisti's repository in addition to mine.
You will most likely need to install PaistiSuite before any of my plugins.
BodUtils will be deprecated, together with BodBreakManager as I've started using PaistiSuite as a base.
